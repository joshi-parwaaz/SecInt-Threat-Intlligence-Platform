INSTRUCTION SUMMARY
This file is a ready-to-copy prompt for an AI slide/PPT generator. It contains precise, project-specific slide content for the SecInt v2 Threat Intelligence Platform. Paste the entire content below into your generative AI (or PPT generator) to create a slide deck. The AI should produce a 16:9 PPTX with speaker notes and simple placeholder visuals.

PROJECT CONTEXT (one paragraph for the AI)
"SecInt v2 is a real-time Threat Intelligence Platform that aggregates Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from public feeds (AlienVault OTX, VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, URLhaus), enriches them with detection and reputation metrics, scores severity using a transparent rule-based engine, and exposes results via an async FastAPI backend and a React dashboard. The system stores enriched IOCs in MongoDB and provides exports for SIEMs and firewalls. The audience for this deck includes security analysts, SOC engineers, and technical stakeholders unfamiliar with the codebase." 

STYLING AND CONSTRAINTS
- Slide format: PPTX, 16:9. Clean, modern layout. Dark-blue / teal color palette.
- Keep each slide concise: up to 3 bullet points, 2–3 speaker-note sentences, and a one-line takeaway.
- Do not include internal repository paths, file names, or raw code dumps. Use placeholder visuals where requested.
- Include speaker notes in the slide notes pane for every slide.

SLIDES (exact ordering and content)

- Title: Problem Statement & Motivation
- Bullets:
  - Analysts overwhelmed by volume of multi-source IOCs
  - Manual triage is slow and error-prone
  - Need automated enrichment and prioritization
- Speaker notes: SOC teams ingest thousands of IOCs across many feeds, creating alert fatigue. Manual review is slow and often misses high-risk items. SecInt addresses this by enriching IOCs and ranking them to focus analyst attention.
- Suggested visual: Funnel or overloaded inbox icon
- Takeaway: Automation and enrichment shorten time-to-detect and reduce noise.

- Title: Project Overview
- Bullets:
  - Aggregates public threat feeds and extracts IOCs
  - Enriches and scores IOCs; stores results centrally
  - Exposes APIs and an interactive React dashboard
- Speaker notes: Briefly describe the end-to-end goal: ingest feeds, perform enrichment (VT detections, abuse confidence), compute a severity score, and provide both UI and API access for triage and automation.
- Suggested visual: High-level pipeline icons (feeds → backend → DB → dashboard)
- Takeaway: Centralized enrichment and scoring converts raw feeds into actionable intel.

- Title: Architecture & Workflow
- Bullets:
  - Background ingestion pulls feeds and extracts indicators
  - Async enrichment and rule-based scoring via FastAPI
  - Motor (async MongoDB) stores enriched IOC records
- Speaker notes: Walk through the pipeline: ingestion services fetch OTX, URLhaus, AbuseIPDB, and VT data; enrichment calls add detection/reputation metrics; the SeverityScorer module assigns scores and reasons; results are stored and served via APIs to the React frontend.
- Suggested visual: Detailed pipeline diagram with components labeled
- Takeaway: The system is built as an async pipeline for efficient I/O-bound tasks.

- Title: Tech Stack
- Bullets:
  - Backend: Python 3.11, FastAPI, Uvicorn, aiohttp
  - Database: MongoDB (Motor); pandas for processing
  - Frontend: React 18, TailwindCSS, Recharts, three-globe
- Speaker notes: Summarize choices: async Python for concurrent API calls, Motor for non-blocking DB IO, and React for interactive visualization. Mention Pydantic models and dotenv usage for config.
- Suggested visual: Grid of tech logos
- Takeaway: Modern, asynchronous stack optimized for enrichment workloads.

- Title: Features
- Bullets:
  - Multi-source aggregation and enrichment
  - Explainable rule-based severity scoring
  - Interactive dashboard and export endpoints
- Speaker notes: Point out key deliverables: aggregated IOCs, severity and reasons for analyst context, filtering and explorer UI, and export formats for SIEMs/firewalls (CSV, JSON, blocklists).
- Suggested visual: Feature icons with short labels
- Takeaway: Features support both human triage and automation workflows.

- Title: Implementation
- Bullets:
  - Ingestion: DirectThreatIngestionService background tasks
  - Scoring: `SeverityScorer` uses VT, malware families, recency
  - API: FastAPI routers for iocs, reports, ingestion
- Speaker notes: Describe important modules: ingestion orchestrates feed pulls and IOC extraction; severity_scorer applies weighted rules (VT detection rate, malware family lists, abuse scores, recency, multiple-source confirmation) and returns severity and reasons; FastAPI exposes endpoints and manages DB lifecycle.
- Suggested visual: Three-column block (Ingest | Score | Serve)
- Takeaway: Implementation separates responsibilities for clarity and maintainability.

- Title: Limitations
- Bullets:
  - Static rules require manual tuning and updates
  - Dependent on third-party API rate limits and costs
  - Lacks production-grade auth, metrics, and retry logic
- Speaker notes: Be candid: the rule-based scorer is transparent but not adaptive; enrichment relies on external quotas which may throttle operations; additional hardening is needed for production (auth, monitoring, caching, backoff, indexing).
- Suggested visual: Warning list with icons
- Takeaway: Prototype-ready but requires operational hardening for production.

- Title: Future Scope
- Bullets:
  - Move ingestion to queue/worker framework for scale
  - Add ML-assisted scoring and multi-source correlation
  - Integrate SIEMs, SOAR, auth, monitoring, caching
- Speaker notes: Offer a roadmap: adopt message queue and worker pools for parallel processing, collect labeled incident data to train ML models that complement rule-based scoring, add connectors to Splunk/QRadar and SOAR playbooks, and implement auth and observability.
- Suggested visual: Roadmap timeline with phases
- Takeaway: Scale, accuracy, and production hardening are the next priorities.

GENERATION GUIDANCE (copy-paste into AI generator)
1) Use the exact slide titles and content above in the given order. Include the speaker notes for each slide in the notes pane.
2) Do not invent project details beyond the context provided. Do not include repo paths or filenames.
3) Use placeholder visuals as suggested (icons, diagrams, or screenshot placeholders). Keep slides concise and professional.
4) Export the final result as PPTX with embedded speaker notes.

SHORT AI COMMAND (one-line to paste)
"Generate a 9-slide PPTX titled 'SecInt v2 — Threat Intelligence Overview' using the exact slide content and ordering in this file. Use a modern dark-blue/teal theme, include speaker notes, and export as PPTX. Do not include internal repo paths or unrelated content."
